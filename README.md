### Bug Reports
A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you! Please make sure to check these points to make a good bug report:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.
2. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a [reduced test
      case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/).
3. A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

### Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.
